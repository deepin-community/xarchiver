    removed. Add them again.
  * [2515903] Add check-for-password-protected-files-on-double-click.patch:
     - Unsafe handling of password protected archives could result in a
       complete freeze of xarchiver. The bug has been triggered by
       double-clicking on files before a valid password had been provided.
       To view an encrypted file by double-clicking on it, it is necessary
       to provide the password via the popup menu (right-click->View) or the
       "Enter password" dialog (main menu) first. (Closes: #633598)
  * [a2bd7b1] Add fix-segfault-non-existent-archive-cmdl-switch-x.patch:

  * New Maintainer. (Closes: #697288)
  * New features and patches:
    - accept-pre-posix-tar-files.patch: Until now xarchiver only allowed to
      open tar files in UStar format because earlier formats did not use magic
      numbers to identify themselves. From now on xarchiver recognizes all tar
      files. (Closes: #574012)
    - Add Fix-format-is-not-a-string-literal-error.patch to prevent a FTBFS.
    - Drop 03-html-icon.patch. Replace the removed html-icon with a free one
      from the lxde-icon-theme which is a better solution for #505778.
    - fix-double-escaping.patch: Now xarchiver handles folders with spaces
      correctly. Special characters are not escaped twice anymore.
      Thanks Guido Berhörster for the patch. (Closes: #697493)
    - no-donators-menu.patch: The "Thanks to" donators menu is gone. A new
      Donate entry points the user to xarchiver's homepage where it is
      possible to contribute to the further development.
    - Merge mime-type.patch with desktop-file.patch.
    - Add new-homepage.patch which replaces the old address in the
      About-dialog with xarchiver's new one at sourceforge.net.
    - Remove all numbers from the patch names.

      3.0 anyway.
    - Add Vcs-fields. Xarchiver will be maintained in a git repository at
      collab-maint from now on.
    - Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.4, no changes needed.
    - Change recommended and suggested packages. Recommend only the most widely
      used and best compressors which are supported by xarchiver and suggest
      all other ones. This means rpm, zip and arj are suggested now. Add
      also unrar-free to Suggests.
  * Provide a new binary package with debugging symbols, xarchiver-dbg, to ease
    debugging in the future.
  * debian/rules:
    - Build with --parallel and autotools_dev.
    - Build with hardening=+all.
    - Build with -Wl, --as-needed to avoid unnecessary dependencies.
  * Remove configure-generated files config.log and config.status from the
    original sources.
  * Register xarchiver manual with doc-base.
  * Update menu and desktop file. Add keywords and remove deprecated UTF-8
